#Earthquake Data Visualization.
• This Application provides a web interface using Python Flask framework to a IBM cloud based DB2 service to investigate
  the earthquakes based on their frequent occurrences i.e. day/night, months, locations and also within a particular radius 
  using greater circle technique.
• Furthermore, Implemented k-means algorithm to classify the USGS earthquake dataset into clusters based on magnitude and depth using
  Scikit Learn, NumPy, Matplotlib libraries.
